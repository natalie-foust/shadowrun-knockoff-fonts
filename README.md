# Shadowrun Knockoff Fonts

Listen chummer, I was planning on making some cheatsheets for my Shadowrun 5e and I wanted em to look all nice and shiny. Unfortunately the corps invented this bulldrek called "DRM" and I wasn't about to spend thousands of nuyen just to buy the "right" to use a certain collection of letters. So, given that perfect is the enemy of the good,  and the corps are the enemy of creativity, I'll curate an assortment of good-enough knockoff fonts here so I can rebuild em on my deck whenever I need.



## The Fonts

You may find the licenses for the three following fonts in the licenses/ directory.

I am only using these fonts for personal use, none of these fonts belong to me and I am not claiming that they do.
